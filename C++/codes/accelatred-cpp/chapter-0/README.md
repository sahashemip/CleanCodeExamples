## Exercises
### 0-0. Compile and run the `Hello, wolrd!` program.
### 0-1. What does the following statement do?
            `3+4;`
### 0-2. Write a program that, when run, writes
            `This (") is a quote, and this (\) is a backslash.`
### 0-3. The string literal `"\t"` represents a tab character; different C++ implementations display tabs in different ways. Experiment with your implementation to learn how it treats tabs.
### 0-4. Write a program that, when run, writes the `Hello, world!` program as its output.
### 0-5. Is this a valid program? Why or why not?
            `include <iostream>`
            `int main()  std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;`
### 0-6. Is this a valid program? Why or why not?
            `#include <iostream>`
            `int main()   {{{{{{ std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl; }}}}}}`
### 0-7. What about this one?
            `#include <iostream>`
            `int main()`
            `{`
                `/* This is a comment that extends over several lines `
                `because it uses /* and */ as its starting and ending delimiters */`
                `std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;`
                `return 0;`
            `}`
### 0-8. ...and this one?
            `#include <iostream>`
            `int main()`
            `{`
                `// This is a comment that extends over several lines`
                `// by using // at the beginning of each line instead of using /*`
                `// or */ to delimit comments.`
                `std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;`
                `return 0;`
            `}`
### 0-9. What is the shortest valid program?
### 0-10. Rewrite the `Hello, world!` program so that a newline occurs everywhere that whitespace is allowed in the program.
