# PythonCleanCodeExamples
Curated examples and best practices for writing clean, maintainable Python code.

This repository contains a collection of poorly written code examples.
Its purpose is to educate fresh developers (like me) on what *not* to do when writing code.
Each example illustrates common mistakes and bad practices in software development.
